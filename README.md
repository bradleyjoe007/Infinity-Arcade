# Info

## **Welcome, Register and Login**
For the welcome page at first there wasnt a player count and the color scheme was the same, but then I changed it to add more variety and some indication that if the user is signed in the pages would be the dark colors I chose for the website. If not they would have the red yellow black theme for the login, register and welcome page. The register page registers the user and saves their account to the database. The user is then required to login to their account using their username and password.

## **Home, Apps and Settings**
The user is then redirected to the home page. The home page contains the recent apps that the user has visited and the most popular ones by times visited. The user can then use the navbar and click Apps. The app page contains all of the applications that have been created. There is a discover sections where all of the applications are listed. There is a section for apps that you can earn money, a section for games that you can't get money. And and other section. The settings doesn't have much settings apart from the ability to change your bet. If you do when you go into an application that you can earn money in, your bet scales the amount of money you can get and the amount of money you give away.

## **FAQ, Updates, Reviews and Leaderboard**
The user is able to ask questions on the FAQ, this can then be accessed by admins. The updates page is a changelog for updates made to the website. The review page allows the user to rate the website out of 5 stars and critic the website. This page also includes the average rating in stars using all of the ratings of the other users. The leaderboard page contains the names of users and orders them in descending order for the amount of money they have, it also shows the money that the user has along with what place they are in. It only shows the top 100 users with the most amount of money. The current user can see what place they are in as it will show at the top of the leaderboard what their current place is.

## **Admin Pages**
This is only accessable by admins that have to be set in *application.py*. If you are an admin, you are able to delete users, give cash to users, see users details like their id and cash amount (the passwords are hashed). And are able to access the information to the FAQ questions that are asked.
